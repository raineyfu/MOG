We've created a productivity web journal for users to document and track their daily routine, as well as take notes of important info and events. The website allows for the creation and tracking of individual user accounts, thus protecting the privacy of user journal entries. Each journal entry corresponds to a specific date, which the user can navigate to quickly using the date sidebar on the right or the journal select on the left. Journal entries can also be selected by clicking on journal titles on the left sidebar. 

<b>
Python must be installed. </b>
<br />
The following Python libraries are also required and can be installed using pip install: <b> Flask, base64, json </b>


To use the journal, download all the files, run app.py, and go to the link provided in its console output.

This application is incredibly scalable and is only limited by hard drive space.

This app was built using HTML, Javascipt, and CSS as the front-end and Python was used for the backend. These technologies were chosen for their simplicity. 

For future development: 
<br />
Add journal text styling
<br />
Task Planner
<br />
Journal Tags
<br />


BUG: cannot type too quickly, else edit journal.json and delete last extra ]
